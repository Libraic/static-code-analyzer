# Static Code Analyzer

Static analysis is used in software engineering by software development and quality assurance teams. Automated tools 
can assist programmers and developers in carrying out static analysis. The software will scan all code in a project to 
check for vulnerabilities while validating the code. 

This is the very purpose of this project, namely to build a tool capable of statically analyzing the code. Building
a static code analyzer which can adjuster per programming language is a hard task. Therefore, a reference language was 
chosen and this is ***Java***. Therefore, the static analysis will only be performed on Java applications. The analyzer
itself is written in Java as well.

> [!NOTE]  
> The development of this static code analyzer is still in progress.

touch with the premises this analyzer is build on.
